# 75-DAYS-RTL

This repository is created with the intension to learn and improve my knowledge of verilog, system verilog and digital circuits.
In this 75 days RTL challenge i will try to cover as many circuits as possible along with the test bench and will try to cover the SV in perspective to verification as well as design.
This repository will certainly help in improving in logic building and learning HDL from design perspective not not just any other coding language.
